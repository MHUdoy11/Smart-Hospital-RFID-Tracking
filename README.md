### Smart Hospital: Hardware-Free RFID Patient Tracking System 

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Development
This project demonstrates modern engineering efficiency:
* **Architecture & Logic:** Designed by Hasan Md Mehedi.
* **Code Generation:** Boilerplate C# and MATLAB scripts generated via Gemini/LLMs.
* **Verification:** All AI-generated code was reviewed, debugged, and optimized for simulation accuracy.

###  Project Overview

This project simulates a Device-Free Localization (DFL) system for healthcare environments.
Traditional patient tracking requires patients to wear tags, which can be uncomfortable or lost. This research proposes a method to track patient location using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) fluctuations from fixed RFID tags on the wall, eliminating the need for wearable devices.

Status: Master's  (Saga University, Japan)
Conference: Accepted for EAI BODYNETS 2025 

### Technologies Used

Simulation Core: MATLAB (RSSI Data Analysis)

Visualization: Unity 3D (C#) & Adobe Illustrator (UI Design)

Data Analysis: Python (Data plotting and verification)](https://github.com/MHUdoy11?tab=repositories

### How It Works

Signal Collection: RFID antennas placed in the room detect signal changes (RSSI) when a person moves.

Processing: MATLAB algorithms filter the noise and calculate the person's coordinate (X, Y).

Visualization: The calculated coordinates are sent to Unity 3D to move a virtual avatar in real-time.

### File Structure

/MATLAB_Sim: Contains the main .m simulation scripts.

/Unity_Project: Contains the C# scripts for the VR visualization.

/Docs: Research papers and presentation slides.

 ### Future Scope

Improving accuracy using Machine Learning algorithms in Python.

Integrating real-time hardware testing with commercial RFID readers.
